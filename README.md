## Tech

### Client

The client is written in Javascript using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and was bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/client-api/) is used to facilitate the socket connection with the server and [peerjs](https://peerjs.com/) was used for the video calling.

### Server

The server is writting in Javascript using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/server-api/) is used to handle websocket connections from clients.

### Running it locally

```sh
git clone git@github.com:axelniklasson/fika.git && cd fika
# launch client on localhost:3000
cd client && yarn && yarn start
# launch server on localhost:3001
cd ../server && yarn && node index.js
```
